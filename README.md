# Math Problem Solver with Gemini API

This project is a web application built with Flask that leverages the Gemini API and machine learning to solve mathematical problems drawn on an interactive canvas. The app uses Google Generative AI for processing and provides solutions in real-time.

## Features

- **Interactive Canvas**: Draw or input a math problem directly on the canvas, which the app captures and processes.
- **Dynamic Canvas Sizing**: Adjust the canvas size to suit your needs with pre-defined dimensions.
- **AI-Powered Solution**: The application processes the input and generates a solution using the Gemini API.
- **Real-Time Responses**: Enjoy fast and efficient processing of queries.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [<repository-url>](https://github.com/JAGADISH262003/gemini_math_solver_canvas.git)
   cd gemini_math_solver_canvas
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the Gemini API key:
   - Replace `your gemini api key` in `app.py` with your actual API key.

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
